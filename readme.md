# Example Trellis Project
This project creates diagrams fro the [Microsoft eShop on Containers](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers/blob/dev/img/eShopOnContainers-architecture.png) project to demonstrate how [TrellisUML](https://github.com/garrettsutula/trellis-uml) can be used to describe a complex system with much less code than the resultant markup generated.

> At first measure, this project generates **538** lines of markup with **180** lines of typescript code - a savings of ***~66%***!
